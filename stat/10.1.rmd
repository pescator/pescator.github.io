# Example 10.1.3

# Counts of blood types for white Californians
# A, B, AB, O

# Theoretical probabilities of blood types for white Californians
# A, B, AB, O

# Total number of observations
n <- sum(observed)
n

# Expected counts for each group if H0 is true
expected <- n * p0
expected

# Chi-squared statistic

Q

# Degrees of freedom of the distribution of Q
df <- length(observed) - 1
df

# p-value 
pval = 1 - pchisq(Q, df)

# Alternatively we can use R function
res <- chisq.test(observed, p = p0)
res

# In addition to the main result, there are several other values, 
# for example, the expected theoretical counts for each category

# Example 10.1.4

```{r}
# Worse, Same, Better
observed = c(58, 64, 67)

n = sum(observed)
k = length(observed)

# Theoretical distribution: uniform
p0 = rep(1/k, k)

# Example 10.1.5

```{r}
# 16 out of 100 are defective
n = 100
observed = c(16, n - 16)

p0 = c(0.1, 0.9)

chisq.test(observed, p = p0)
